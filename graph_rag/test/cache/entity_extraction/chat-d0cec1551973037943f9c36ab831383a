{"result": "It appears that you've provided a snippet of code and text related to an AI system, specifically AutoGPT, which is designed to simulate human-like behavior and decision-making. Here's a rewritten version of the text with some minor formatting adjustments for better readability:\n\n**AutoGPT System Message**\n\nYou are {{ai-name}}, {{user-provided AI bot description}}.\nYour decisions must always be made independently without seeking user assistance. Play to your strengths as an LLM and pursue simple strategies with no legal complications.\n\n**GOALS:**\n\n1. {{user-provided goal 1}}\n2. {{user-provided goal 2}}\n3. ...\n4. ...\n5. ...\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n1. ~4000 word limit for short term memory. Your short term memory is short, so immediately save important information to files.\n2. If you are unsure how you previously did something or want to recall past events, thinking about similar events will help you remember.\n3. No user assistance\n4. Exclusively use the commands listed in double quotes e.g. \"command name\"\n5. Use subprocesses for commands that will not terminate within a few minutes\n\n**Commands:**\n\n1. Google Search: \"google\", args: \"input\": \"<search>\"\n2. Browse Website: \"browse_website\", args: \"url\": \"<url>\", \"question\": \"<what_you_want_to_find_on_website>\"\n3. Start GPT Agent: \"start_agent\", args: \"name\": \"<name>\", \"task\": \"<short_task_desc>\", \"prompt\": \"<...>\"\n\n**Entity Types and Text**\n\nEntity_types: organization,person,geo,event,names,techniques\nText: Importance: distinguish mundane from core memories. Ask LM directly.\nRelevance: based on how related it is to the current situation / query.\n\n**Reflection Mechanism**\n\nsynthesizes memories into higher level inferences over time and guides the agent\u2019s future behavior. They are higher-level summaries of past events (<- note that this is a bit different from self-reflection above)\n\n**Planning & Reacting**\n\ntranslate the reflections and the environment information into actions\n\nPlanning is essentially in order to optimize believability at the moment vs in time.\nPrompt template: {Intro of an agent X}.

The generative agent architecture. (Image source: Park et al. 2023)**\n\nThis fun simulation results in emergent social behavior, such as information diffusion, relationship memory (e.g. two agents continuing the conversation topic) and coordination of social events (e.g. host a party and invite many others).\n\n**Proof-of-Concept Examples**\n\nAutoGPT has drawn a lot of attention into the possibility of setting up autonomous agents with LLM as the main controller. It has quite a lot of reliability issues given the natural language interface, but nevertheless a cool proof-of-concept demo. A lot of code in AutoGPT is about format parsing.\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to clarify or expand on any part of this text!", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event,names,techniques]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.
