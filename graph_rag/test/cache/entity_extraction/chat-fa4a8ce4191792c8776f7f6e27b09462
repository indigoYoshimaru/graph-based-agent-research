{"result": "It appears that the provided text is a continuation of a previous conversation about natural language processing (NLP) and conversational AI. The output you're looking for seems to be related to the topic of \"Automatic Prompt Design\" in NLP.\n\nHere's a possible answer based on the provided text:\n\n**Automatic Prompt Design**\n\nPrompt design is an essential aspect of NLP, particularly in conversational AI. A prompt is a sequence of prefix tokens that increase the probability of getting the desired output given input. To optimize prompts directly on the embedding space via gradient descent, several methods have been proposed, including:\n\n1. **AutoPrompt** (Shin et al., 2020): Treats prompts as trainable parameters and optimizes them using gradient descent.\n2. **Prefix-Tuning** (Li & Liang, 2021): Simplifies the prompt design process by directly tuning the prefix tokens.\n3. **P-tuning** (Liu et al., 2021): Further simplifies the prompt design process by only tuning a subset of the prefix tokens.\n4. **Prompt-Tuning** (Lester et al., 2021): A more recent approach that simplifies the prompt design process even further.\n\nThese methods aim to improve the performance of conversational AI models by optimizing the prompts used to interact with them.\n\nAdditionally, other approaches have been proposed to improve prompt design, such as:\n\n* **APE** (Automatic Prompt Engineer; Zhou et al., 2022): Searches over a pool of model-generated instruction candidates and filters them based on a chosen score function.\n* **Self-Ask** (Press et al., 2022): A method that repeatedly prompts the model to ask following-up questions to construct the thought process iteratively.\n\nThese approaches demonstrate the growing interest in improving prompt design for conversational AI, with a focus on making the process more efficient and effective.", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event,technology]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

Nonfactual explanations most likely lead to incorrect predictions.\n\n\nSelf-Ask (Press et al. 2022) is a method to repeatedly prompt the model to ask following-up questions to construct the thought process iteratively. Follow-up questions can be answered by search engine results. Similarly, IRCoT (Interleaving Retrieval CoT; Trivedi et al. 2022) and ReAct (Reason + Act; Yao et al. 2023) combines iterative CoT prompting with queries to Wikipedia APIs to search for relevant entities and content and then add it back into the context.\n\n\n\nFig. 1. How Self-Ask works with external search queries.(Image source: Press et al. 2022).\n\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, essentially creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS or DFS while each state is evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\n\n\nFig. 2.
