Identify all entities.

Take the picture of a Shiba Inu in Fig. 1 as an example.\n\nFig. 1. A Shiba Inu in a men\u2019s outfit. The credit of the original photo goes to Instagram @mensweardog.\nHuman visual attention allows us to focus on a certain region with \u201chigh resolution\u201d (i.e. look at the pointy ear in the yellow box) while perceiving the surrounding image in \u201clow resolution\u201d (i.e. now how about the snowy background and the outfit?), and then adjust the focal point or do the inference accordingly. Given a small patch of an image, pixels in the rest provide clues what should be displayed there. We expect to see a pointy ear in the yellow box because we have seen a dog\u2019s nose, another pointy ear on the right, and Shiba\u2019s mystery eyes (stuff in the red boxes). However, the sweater and blanket at the bottom would not be as helpful as those doggy features.\nSimilarly, we can explain the relationship between words in one sentence or close context. When we see \u201ceating\u201d, we expect to encounter a food word very soon. The color term describes the food, but probably not so much with \u201ceating\u201d directly.\n\nFig. 2. One word \"attends\" to other words in the same sentence differently.\nIn a nutshell, attention in deep learning can be broadly interpreted as a vector of importance weights: in order to predict or infer one element, such as a pixel in an image\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3.1", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
