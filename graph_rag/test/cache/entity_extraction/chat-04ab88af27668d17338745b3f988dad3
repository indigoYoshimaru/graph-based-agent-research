The area designated by UNESCO as the World Natural Heritage Site incorporates 434\u00a0km2 (168\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) with 775 islets, of which the core zone is delimited by 69 points: Dau Go island on the west, Ba Ham lake on the south and Cong Tay island on the east. The protected area is from the C\u00e1i D\u0103m petrol store to Quang Hanh ward, C\u1ea9m Ph\u1ea3 city and the surrounding zone.\n\nClimate[edit]\nThe climate of the bay is tropical, wet, sea islands, with two seasons: hot and moist summer, dry and cold winter. The average temperature is from 15\u201325\u00a0\u00b0C (59\u201377\u00a0\u00b0F), and annual rainfall is between 2 and 2.2 metres (6.6 and 7.2\u00a0ft). H\u1ea1 Long Bay has the typical diurnal tide system (tide amplitude ranges from 3.5\u20134 metres or 11\u201313 feet). The salinity is from 31 to 34.5MT in the dry season and lower in the rainy season.\n\nPopulation[edit]\nOf the 1,969 islands in H\u1ea1 Long, only approximately 40 are inhabited. These islands range from tens to thousands of hectares in size, mainly in the East and Southeast of H\u1ea1 Long Bay. In recent decades, thousands of villagers have been starting to settle down on the pristine islands and build new communities such as Sa T\u00f4 Island (H\u1ea1 Long City) and Th\u1eafng L\u1ee3i Island (V\u00e2n \u0110\u1ed3n district).\n\nL\u00e0ng Ch\u00e0i Floating Fishing Village\nThe population of H\u1ea1 Long Bay is about 1,540, mainly in C\u1eeda V\u1ea1n, Ba Hang and C\u1eb7p D\u00e8 fishing villages (H\u00f9ng Th\u1eafng Ward, H\u1ea1 Long City). Residents of the bay mostly live on boats and rafts buoyed by tires and plastic jugs to facilitate the fishing, cultivating and breeding of aquatic and marine species. Fish require feeding every other day for up to three years, when they are eventually sold to local seafood restaurants for up to 300,000 Vietnamese dong per kilogram. Today, the lives of H\u1ea1 Long Bay inhabitants have much improved due to new travel businesses. Residents of the floating villages around H\u1ea1 Long Bay now offer bedrooms for rent, boat tours, and fresh seafood meals to tourists. While this is an isolating, back-breaking lifestyle, floating village residents are considered wealthy compared to residents of other H\u1ea1 Long Bay islands.\nAt present [when?], the Qu\u1ea3ng Ninh provincial government has a policy to relocate the households living in the bay to resettle, in order to stabilize their life and to protect the landscape of the heritage zone\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3.1", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
