{"result": "It seems like you're providing a snippet from a research paper or a technical document related to natural language processing, specifically focusing on augmented language models and their applications in tasks such as question answering, dialogue systems, and human-computer interaction. The text discusses various methods for improving the performance of these models, including iterative Monte Carlo search, chain-of-thought prompts, clustering techniques, and retrieval-based approaches.\n\nTo answer your initial question about rewriting human history based on the provided snippet, it's not directly related to that topic. However, the concepts discussed can be applied in a broader sense to any task involving complex decision-making or problem-solving, potentially including historical scenarios if one were to imagine a scenario where AI models are used to simulate or predict historical outcomes.\n\nIf you'd like to explore how these concepts could theoretically apply to rewriting human history, it would involve significant extrapolation and hypothetical application of the ideas presented. For instance:\n\n1. **Iterative Monte Carlo Search**: This method could be used in a hypothetical scenario where AI is tasked with predicting or simulating different historical outcomes based on various factors such as political decisions, economic conditions, etc. The search process would iteratively refine its predictions to better align with actual outcomes.\n\n2. **Chain-of-Thought Prompts**: In a thought experiment, these could be used to generate hypothetical scenarios of how human history might have unfolded differently under the influence of AI-driven decision-making or predictive models. This would involve generating chains of reasoning that lead to alternative historical paths.\n\n3. **Clustering Techniques and Retrieval-Based Approaches**: These methods could theoretically be applied in a scenario where AI is tasked with identifying patterns in historical data, predicting outcomes based on those patterns, and then using retrieval-based approaches to incorporate new information into its decision-making process.\n\nHowever, it's crucial to note that these applications are highly speculative and not directly related to the original snippet provided. The snippet focuses more on improving the performance of AI models for specific tasks rather than applying them in a historical context.", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event,names]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

(2023) suggested augment-prune-select, a three-step process:\n\nAugment: Generate multiple pseudo-chains of thought given question using few-shot or zero-shot CoT prompts;\nPrune: Prune pseudo chains based on whether generated answers match ground truths.\nSelect: Apply a variance-reduced policy gradient strategy to learn the probability distribution over selected examples, while considering the probability distribution over examples as policy and the validation set accuracy as reward.\n\nZhang et al. (2023) instead adopted clustering techniques to sample questions and then generates chains. They observed that LLMs tend to make certain types of mistakes. One type of errors can be similar in the emebedding space and thus get grouped together. By only sampling one or a few from frequent-error clusters, we can prevent too many wrong demonstrations of one error type and collect a diverse set of examples.\n\nQuestion clustering: Embed questions and run $k$-means for clustering.\nDemonstration selection: Select a set of representative questions from each cluster; i.e. one demonstration from one cluster. Samples in each cluster are sorted by distance to the cluster centroid and those closer to the centroid are selected first.\nRationale generation: Use zero-shot CoT to generate reasoning chains for selected questions and construct few-shot prompt to run inference.\n\nAugmented Language Models#\nA survey on augmented language models by Mialon et al.
