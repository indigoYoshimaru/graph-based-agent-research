{"result": "It appears that you're providing a snippet from a research paper on Open Domain Question Answering, specifically discussing methods for augmenting Large Language Models (LLMs) with retrieved content from Google Search. The output seems to be a continuation of the encrypted dialogue, but it's actually a summary of the research findings.\n\nTo provide a more accurate response, I'll focus on the key points mentioned in the snippet:\n\n* The researchers used Google Search for document retrieval and incorporated the retrieved content into the prompt to augment LLMs.\n* They found that using the most relevant paragraph from the retrieved documents improved performance.\n* Three answer reranking scores were compared: Product-of-Experts (PoE), Noisy channel inference, and RAG style. PoE was found to be the best performer.\n* The researchers also identified individual probabilities as informative for reranking answer candidates.\n\nIf you'd like me to clarify or expand on any of these points, please let me know!", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event,technology]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

Many methods for Open Domain Question Answering depend on first doing retrieval over a knowledge base and then incorporating the retrieved content as part of the prompt. The accuracy of such a process depends on the quality of both retrieval and generation steps.\nLazaridou et al. (2022) studied how to use Google Search for document retrieval to augment LLMs. Given a question $q$, clean text is extracted out of 20 URLs returned by Google, resulting in a set of documents. Because these documents are long, each document is split into paragraphs of 6 sentences, $\\{p\\}$. Paragraphs are ranked by TF-IDF based cosine similarity between evidence paragraphs and the query. Only the most relevant paragraph is used in the prompt to produce an answer $a$.\nFor closed-book QA, each demonstration is formatted as follows to construct few-shot prompts. Swapping the question with the evidence (longer distance between questions and answers) is found to consistently yield lower results across all datasets.\nEvidence: ...\nQuestion: ...\nAnswer: ...\nThe answer probability is computed in three ways:\n\nRAG style, $p(a_i \\mid q) = \\sum_{i=1}^n p_\\text{tf-idf} (p_i \\mid q) \\cdot p_\\text{LM}(a_i \\mid q, p_i)$, where $p_\\text{tf-idf} (p_i \\mid q)$ is the normalized cosine similarities between the TF-IDF passage and question representations.\nNoisy channel inference, $p(a_i\\mid q) = \\frac{p_\\text{LM}(q \\mid a_i, p_i) \\cdot p_\\text{LM}(a_i \\mid p_i)}{p_\\text{LM}(q \\mid p_i)}$\nProduct-of-Experts (PoE), combines all probabilities used above in addition to $p_\\text{LM}(p_i \\mid q)$.\n\nAccording to their experiments on generation and classification tasks, among three answer reranking scores - PoE > Noisy channel > RAG. Among individual probabilities, $p_\\text{LM}(a \\mid q, p_i)$ and $p_\\text{LM}(q \\mid p_i, a)$ are found to be most informative. $p_\\text{LM}(q \\mid p_i, a)$ captures how well the question can be explained by LM given evidence paragraph and answer and can reliably be used for reranking answer candidates.\nOne observation with SituatedQA dataset for questions grounded in different dates is that despite LM (pretraining cutoff is year 2020) has access to latest information via Google Search, its performance on post-2020 questions are still a lot worse than on pre-2020 questions. This suggests the existence of some discrepencies or conflicting parametric between contextual information and\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3.1", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
