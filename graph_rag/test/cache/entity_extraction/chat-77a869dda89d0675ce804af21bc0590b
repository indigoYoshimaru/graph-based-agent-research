However, Ha Long Bay has also been invaded by the sea so that the geomorphology of its limestone islands are, at least in part, the consequence of marine erosion. The marine invasion distinguishes Ha Long Bay and makes it unique in the world. There are other areas of submerged karst towers which were invaded by the sea, but none is as extensive as Ha Long Bay.\n[16]\n[19]\n\nTimeline of geologic evolution[edit]\nSome of the most remarkable geological events in Ha Long Bay's history have occurred in the last 1,000 years, include the advance of the sea, the raising of the bay area, strong erosion that has formed coral, and, pure blue and heavily salted water. This process of erosion by seawater has deeply engraved the stone, contributing to its fantastic beauty. Present-day Ha Long Bay is the result of this long process of geological evolution that has been influenced by so many factors.\nDue to all these factors, tourists visiting Ha Long Bay are not only treated to one of the natural wonders of the world, but also to a precious geological museum that has been naturally preserved in the open air for the last 300 million years.\n\n\n\nYears ago\nGeologic period\nEvents\n\n\n570,000,000\u2013500,000,000\nBeginning of the Cambrian Period\nThe area, which now forms Ha Long Bay, was mostly mainland, subject to a process of rain-induced erosion.\n\n\n\nEnd of the Cambrian Period\nThe area was flooded, bringing Ha Long Bay into existence.\n\n\n500,000,000\u2013400,000,000\nOrdovician and Silurian periods\nThe area of north-east Vietnam was akin to deep sea, subjected to the constant activity of tectonic plates.\n\n\n\nEnd of the Silurian Period\nIt underwent a phase of inverse-motion that created mountains deep under the water.\n\n\n420,000,000\u2013340,000,000\nEnd of the Silurian Period and throughout the whole Devonian Period\nThe area was subjected to powerful forces of erosion from the hot and dry climate. At this point, Ha Long was part of a wide mainland that comprised most of today's South China Sea and the Chinese continental shelf.\n\n\n\nEnd of the Devonian Period\nDue to tectonic activity, the Ha Long area and the entire north-east region were raised from the depths.\n\n\n340,000,000\u2013240,000,000\nLater Carboniferous and Permian periods\nThe formation of the limestone layer more than 1,000 m thick.
