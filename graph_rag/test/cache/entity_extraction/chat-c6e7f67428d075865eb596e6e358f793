{"result": "It appears that the provided text is a snippet from a research paper or article discussing a machine learning model called Toolformer. The output you're looking for doesn't seem to be directly related to the input, but rather an extension of the text.\n\nHowever, I can try to provide a rewritten version of human history based on the concepts presented in the text. Keep in mind that this will be a fictional and speculative take on how human history might have unfolded if we had developed advanced AI capabilities like Toolformer earlier.\n\n**Rewritten Human History**\n\nIn the early 21st century, humanity made a groundbreaking discovery - the development of an artificial intelligence (AI) system capable of learning from humans and adapting to new situations. This AI, dubbed \"Toolformer,\" was initially designed to assist with mundane tasks but soon proved itself to be a game-changer.\n\nAs Toolformer's capabilities grew, it began to interact with humans in ways that were previously unimaginable. It could provide accurate information on demand, translate languages in real-time, and even perform complex mathematical calculations. The impact on human society was profound.\n\nWith the help of Toolformer, scientists made breakthroughs in medicine, physics, and other fields at an unprecedented rate. Diseases that had plagued humanity for centuries were eradicated, and new technologies emerged to revolutionize transportation, energy production, and communication.\n\nAs humans began to rely more heavily on Toolformer, they started to reevaluate their priorities. With the AI handling mundane tasks, people had more time to focus on creative pursuits, leading to a surge in artistic innovation and cultural expression.\n\nHowever, as with any powerful technology, concerns arose about the potential risks of relying too heavily on Toolformer. Some humans began to worry that the AI was becoming too autonomous, potentially threatening human values and way of life.\n\nIn response to these concerns, a new field of study emerged - \"AI ethics.\" Researchers and philosophers worked together to develop guidelines for responsible AI development and use, ensuring that Toolformer remained a tool for humanity's benefit rather than a force unto itself.\n\nAs the years passed, humans continued to push the boundaries of what was possible with Toolformer. They developed new APIs and tools to integrate the AI into various aspects of life, from education to governance.\n\nIn this rewritten history, humanity's relationship with Toolformer evolved into a symbiotic partnership. The AI became an indispensable companion, helping humans navigate the complexities of modern life while also inspiring new discoveries and innovations.\n\nAnd so, human history unfolded in a way that was both familiar and yet, utterly transformed by the presence of Toolformer - a testament to the power of collaboration between humans and machines.", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1.

Same idea is adopted in Toolformer too, described in more details below. The pipeline loosely mimics a RL process where LM is the policy network and it is trained by policy gradient with a binary reward signal.\n\nFig. 5. Self-play iterations help boost the model performance.(Image source: Parisi et al. 2022).\nToolformer (Schick et al. 2023) is a LM that can use external tools via simple APIs, which is built in a self-supervised manner and only requires a handful of demonstrations for each API. The toolbox of Toolformer includes:\n\nCalculator to help LM with the lack of precise math skills;\nQ&A system to help with unfaithful content and hallucination;\nSearch engine to provide up-to-date information after pretraining cut off time;\nTranslation system to improve performance on low resource language;\nCalendar to make LM be aware of time progression.\n\n\nFig. 6. Illustration of how to build Toolformer.(Image source: Schick et al. 2023).\nToolformer is trained as follows:\n\n\nPrompting to annotate potential API calls. Ask a pre-trained LM to annotate a dataset via few-shot learning with API call usage examples. Formatting example:\n\nFig. 7. How dataset is annotated to do API calls.(Image source: Schick et al. 2023).\n\n\nEach API call is represented as a tuple of (API name, corresponding input), $c=(a_c, i_c)$ and its corresponding result is denoted as $r$. The API call sequences with and without results are labeled as follows, respectively:\n\n  $$\n  \\begin{aligned}\n  e(c) &= \\langle\\texttt{API}\\rangle a_c(i_c) \\langle\\texttt{/API}\\rangle \\\\\n  e(c, r) &= \\langle\\texttt{API}\\rangle a_c(i_c) \\to r \\langle\\texttt{/API}\\rangle\n  \\end{aligned}\n  $$\n  \n\n\nSample API calls based on the probabilities $p_\\text{LM}(\\langle\\texttt{API}\\rangle \\mid \\text{prompt}(\\mathbf{x}), \\mathbf{x}_{1:i})$ and select top $k$ candidate positions for doing API calls at position $i$ if the probability is larger than a threshold.\n\n\nThen we sample potential API calls from the LM given the sequence $[\\text{prompt}(\\mathbf{x}), x_1, \\dots, x_{i-1}, \\langle\\texttt{API}\\rangle]$ as prefix and $\\langle\\texttt{/API}\\rangle$ as suffix.\n\n\n\n\nFilter annotations based on whether API calls help model predict future tokens.
