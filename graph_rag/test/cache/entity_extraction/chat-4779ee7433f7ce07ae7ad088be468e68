{"result": "It appears that you've provided a snippet of text from a research paper or academic article. I'll do my best to summarize and respond to your question.\n\nYou asked if someone could rewrite human history, but it seems like you're actually referring to a hypothetical scenario where an unknown intelligence is communicating with humans, and the dialogue is unfolding in a complex pattern.\n\nTo answer your original question: No, rewriting human history is not possible. Human history is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that has unfolded over thousands of years, shaped by countless events, decisions, and interactions among individuals and groups. While historians and scholars can reinterpret and recontextualize historical events, they cannot change the actual course of history.\n\nHowever, if you're asking about the possibility of an unknown intelligence influencing human history or rewriting it in some way, that's a more speculative and intriguing question! In that case, I'd be happy to engage in a thought experiment with you.", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities.

(Image source: Yao et al. 2023).\nIn both experiments on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making tasks, ReAct works better than the Act-only baseline where Thought: \u2026 step is removed.\nReflexion (Shinn & Labash 2023) is a framework to equips agents with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve reasoning skills. Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection results.\n\nFig. 3. Illustration of the Reflexion framework. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\nThe heuristic function determines when the trajectory is inefficient or contains hallucination and should be stopped. Inefficient planning refers to trajectories that take too long without success. Hallucination is defined as encountering a sequence of consecutive identical actions that lead to the same observation in the environment.\nSelf-reflection is created by showing two-shot examples to LLM and each example is a pair of (failed trajectory, ideal reflection for guiding future changes in the plan). Then reflections are added into the agent\u2019s working memory, up to three, to be used as context for querying LLM.\n\nFig. 4. Experiments on AlfWorld Env and HotpotQA. Hallucination is a more common failure than inefficient planning in AlfWorld. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\nChain of Hindsight (CoH; Liu et al. 2023) encourages the model to improve on its own outputs by explicitly presenting it with a sequence of past outputs, each annotated with feedback. Human feedback data is a collection of $D_h = \\{(x, y_i , r_i , z_i)\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $x$ is the prompt, each $y_i$ is a model completion, $r_i$ is the human rating of $y_i$, and $z_i$ is the corresponding human-provided hindsight feedback. Assume the feedback tuples are ranked by reward, $r_n \\geq r_{n-1} \\geq \\dots \\geq r_1$ The process is supervised fine-tuning where the data is a sequence in the form of $\\tau_h = (x, z_i, y_i, z_j, y_j, \\dots, z_n, y_n)$, where $\\leq i \\leq j \\leq n$. The model is finetuned to only predict $y_n$ where conditioned on the\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3.1", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
