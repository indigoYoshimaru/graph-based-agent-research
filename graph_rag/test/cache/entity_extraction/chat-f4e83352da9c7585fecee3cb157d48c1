{"result": "It appears that you've provided a snippet of text from a research paper or article on natural language processing and artificial intelligence. The output you're looking for is not a specific answer to a question, but rather the continuation of the text.\n\nHere's the rest of the text:\n\n...TALM (Tool Augmented Language Models) and MRKL (Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language) are two examples of architectures that incorporate external tools into LLMs. TALM uses a modular architecture where each module is responsible for a specific task, such as language understanding or generation. MRKL, on the other hand, uses a neuro-symbolic approach where a general-purpose LLM works in conjunction with expert modules to perform tasks.\n\nThe use of external tools can significantly extend the capabilities of LLMs. For example, using a calculator module can enable an LLM to perform arithmetic operations that it may not be able to do on its own. However, as the experiment by Karpas et al. (2022) showed, even with the aid of external tools, LLMs may still struggle with certain tasks, such as solving verbal math problems.\n\nThe use of external tools also raises questions about the role of human intelligence in AI systems. As we equip LLMs with more and more tools, do we risk creating systems that are less intelligent or less capable than humans? Or can we use these tools to augment human intelligence and create more powerful AI systems?\n\nThese are just some of the questions that researchers are exploring as they continue to develop and refine LLMs. The future of language understanding and generation is likely to be shaped by the interplay between human creativity, machine learning algorithms, and external tools.\n\n...", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1.

When performing a search, HNSW starts from a random node in the top layer and navigates towards the target. When it can\u2019t get any closer, it moves down to the next layer, until it reaches the bottom layer. Each move in the upper layers can potentially cover a large distance in the data space, and each move in the lower layers refines the search quality.\nFAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): It operates on the assumption that in high dimensional space, distances between nodes follow a Gaussian distribution and thus there should exist clustering of data points. FAISS applies vector quantization by partitioning the vector space into clusters and then refining the quantization within clusters. Search first looks for cluster candidates with coarse quantization and then further looks into each cluster with finer quantization.\nScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors): The main innovation in ScaNN is anisotropic vector quantization. It quantizes a data point $x_i$ to $\\tilde{x}_i$ such that the inner product $\\langle q, x_i \\rangle$ is as similar to the original distance of $\\angle q, \\tilde{x}_i$ as possible, instead of picking the closet quantization centroid points.\n\n\nFig. 9.

We create, modify and utilize external objects to do things that go beyond our physical and cognitive limits. Equipping LLMs with external tools can significantly extend the model capabilities.\n\nFig. 10. A picture of a sea otter using rock to crack open a seashell, while floating in the water. While some other animals can use tools, the complexity is not comparable with humans. (Image source: Animals using tools)\nMRKL (Karpas et al. 2022), short for \u201cModular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language\u201d, is a neuro-symbolic architecture for autonomous agents. A MRKL system is proposed to contain a collection of \u201cexpert\u201d modules and the general-purpose LLM works as a router to route inquiries to the best suitable expert module. These modules can be neural (e.g. deep learning models) or symbolic (e.g. math calculator, currency converter, weather API).\nThey did an experiment on fine-tuning LLM to call a calculator, using arithmetic as a test case. Their experiments showed that it was harder to solve verbal math problems than explicitly stated math problems because LLMs (7B Jurassic1-large model) failed to extract the right arguments for the basic arithmetic reliably. The results highlight when the external symbolic tools can work reliably, knowing when to and how to use the tools are crucial, determined by the LLM capability.\nBoth TALM (Tool Augmented Language Models;\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3.1", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
