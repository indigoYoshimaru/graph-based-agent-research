From Jiayu Pass the wall travels discontinuously down the Hexi Corridor and into the deserts of Ningxia, where it enters the western edge of the Yellow River loop at Yinchuan. Here the first major walls erected during the Ming dynasty cut through the Ordos Desert to the eastern edge of the Yellow River loop. There at Piantou Pass (t \u504f\u982d\u95dc, s \u504f\u5934\u5173, Pi\u0101nt\u00f3ugu\u0101n) in Xinzhou, Shanxi province, the Great Wall splits in two with the \"Outer Great Wall\" (t \u5916\u9577\u57ce, s \u5916\u957f\u57ce, W\u00e0i Ch\u01cengch\u00e9ng) extending along the Inner Mongolia border with Shanxi into Hebei province, and the \"Inner Great Wall\" (t \u5167\u9577\u57ce, s \u5167\u957f\u57ce, N\u00e8i Ch\u01cengch\u00e9ng) running southeast from Piantou Pass for some 400\u00a0km (250\u00a0mi), passing through important passes like the Pingxing Pass and Yanmen Pass before joining the Outer Great Wall at Sihaiye (\u56db\u6d77\u51b6, S\u00ech\u01ceiy\u011b), in Beijing's Yanqing County.\nThe sections of the Great Wall around Beijing municipality are especially famous: they were frequently renovated and are regularly visited by tourists today. The Badaling Great Wall near Zhangjiakou is the most famous stretch of the wall, for this was the first section to be opened to the public in the People's Republic of China, as well as the showpiece stretch for foreign dignitaries.[53] The Badaling Great Wall saw nearly 10 million visitors in 2018, and in 2019, a daily limit of 65,000 visitors was instated.[54] South of Badaling is the Juyong Pass; when it was used by the Chinese to protect their land, this section of the wall had many guards to defend the capital Beijing. Made of stone and bricks from the hills, this portion of the Great Wall is 7.8\u00a0m (25\u00a0ft 7\u00a0in) high and 5\u00a0m (16\u00a0ft 5\u00a0in) wide.\n\nMing dynasty Great Wall at Jinshanling\nOne of the most striking sections of the Ming Great Wall is where it climbs extremely steep slopes in Jinshanling. There it runs 11\u00a0km (7\u00a0mi) long, ranges from 5 to 8\u00a0m (16\u00a0ft 5\u00a0in to 26\u00a0ft 3\u00a0in) in height, and 6\u00a0m (19\u00a0ft 8\u00a0in) across the bottom, narrowing up to 5\u00a0m (16\u00a0ft 5\u00a0in) across the top.
