For example, you could ask me to:\n\n* Extract entity types (e.g., organization, person, geo) and their corresponding values\n* Summarize the history of H\u1ea1 Long Bay, including its cultural periods (Soi Nh\u1ee5, C\u00e1i B\u00e8o, H\u1ea1 Long)\n* Identify key events mentioned in the article (e.g., Battle of B\u1ea1ch \u0110\u1eb1ng, raising of the national flag)\n\nLet me know how I can assist you!", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event,names,techniques]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

More than 300 households living in fishing villages in H\u1ea1 Long Bay have been relocated ashore in Khe C\u00e1 Resettlement Area, now known as Zone 8 (H\u00e0 Phong Ward, H\u1ea1 Long City) since May 2014.

There are remains from mounds of mountain shellfish (Cyclophorus), spring shellfish (Melania, also called Thiana), some freshwater water mollusc and some rudimentary labour tools. The main way of life of Soi Nh\u1ee5's inhabitants included catching fish and shellfish, collecting fruits and digging for bulbs and roots.
