From the island's perimeter cliff a cave, 10m wide at water level and curving so that it is almost completely dark, extends about 150m to Lake 1. Luon Cave is on Bo Hon Island and extends 50m meters to an enclosed tidal lake. It has a massive stalactite hanging 2m down and truncated at the modern tidal level. It has passed through many stages in its formation.\nThe karst landscape of H\u1ea1 Long Bay is of international significance and of fundamental importance to the science of geomorphology. The fenglin tower karst, which is the type present in much of H\u1ea1 Long Bay, is the most extreme form of limestone landscape development. If these karst landscapes are broadly compared in terms of their height, steepness and number of their limestone towers, H\u1ea1 Long Bay is probably second in the entire world only to Yangshuo, in China. However, H\u1ea1 Long Bay has also been invaded by the sea so that the geomorphology of its limestone islands are, at least in part, the consequence of marine erosion. The marine invasion distinguishes H\u1ea1 Long Bay and makes it unique in the world. There are other areas of submerged karst towers which were invaded by the sea, but none is as extensive as H\u1ea1 Long Bay.\n[16]\n[19]\n\nTimeline of geologic evolution[edit]\nSome of the most remarkable geological events in H\u1ea1 Long Bay's history have occurred in the last 1,000 years, include the advance of the sea, the raising of the bay area, strong erosion that has formed coral, and, pure blue and heavily salted water. This process of erosion by seawater has deeply engraved the stone, contributing to its fantastic beauty. Present-day H\u1ea1 Long Bay is the result of this long process of geological evolution that has been influenced by so many factors.\nDue to all these factors, tourists visiting H\u1ea1 Long Bay are not only treated to one of the natural wonders of the world, but also to a precious geological museum that has been naturally preserved in the open air for the last 300 million years.\n\n\n\nYears ago\nGeologic period\nEvents\n\n\n570,000,000\u2013500,000,000\nBeginning of the Cambrian Period\nThe area, which now forms H\u1ea1 Long Bay, was mostly mainland, subject to a process of rain-induced erosion.\n\n\n\nEnd of the Cambrian Period\nThe area was flooded, bringing H\u1ea1 Long Bay into existence.\n\n\n500,000,000\u2013400,000,000\nOrdovician and Silurian periods\nThe area of north-east Vietnam was akin to deep sea, subjected to the constant activity of tectonic plates.\n\n\n\nEnd of the Silurian Period\nIt underwent a phase of inverse-motion that created mountains deep under the water.\n\n\n420,000,000\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3.1", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
