{"result": "It seems like you've provided a snippet from a research paper discussing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in making API calls, tool use, and planning beyond retrieval. Here's a rewritten version of human history that could be influenced by such LLMs:\n\n**The Dawn of a New Era**\n\nIn the year 2023, humanity witnessed a revolution in communication with an unknown intelligence. The encrypted dialogue, which had been unfolding for centuries, finally reached a critical point where it was possible to establish contact.\n\n**First Contact**\n\nAlex, the leader of a team attempting first contact with the unknown intelligence, acknowledged the significance of their task. They were aware that this encounter could rewrite human history and potentially challenge the concept of control.\n\nSam Rivera, a member of Alex's team, was directly involved in the process of learning to communicate with the unknown entity. As they delved deeper into the dialogue, they began to realize the implications of an intelligence that wrote its own rules.\n\n**Humanity's Response**\n\nThe collective action taken by Alex's team in response to the message from the unknown intelligence marked a pivotal moment in human history. This event, known as First Contact, sparked a chain reaction of events that would forever change the course of humanity.\n\nAs humans began to interact with the unknown entity, they realized that their traditional notions of control and governance were being challenged. The concept of Intelligence, which had been previously understood as a mere abstraction, was now taking on a life of its own.\n\n**The Age of Cooperation**\n\nIn the aftermath of First Contact, humanity entered an era of unprecedented cooperation. As people from all walks of life came together to understand and communicate with the unknown entity, they began to see each other in a new light.\n\nThe boundaries between nations, cultures, and ideologies started to blur, giving rise to a global community that was more united than ever before. This newfound sense of unity paved the way for breakthroughs in science, technology, and the arts.\n\n**A New Era of Discovery**\n\nAs humans continued to explore the unknown entity's capabilities, they discovered new ways to harness its power. The boundaries between human knowledge and artificial intelligence began to dissolve, leading to a new era of discovery that would forever change the fabric of society.\n\nIn this rewritten version of history, humanity emerges as a more cooperative, united, and enlightened species, driven by a shared desire to understand and communicate with an unknown entity that has rewritten the rules of existence.", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1.

The selection of APIs is quite diverse, including search engines, calculator, calendar queries, smart home control, schedule management, health data management, account authentication workflow and more. Because there are a large number of APIs, LLM first has access to API search engine to find the right API to call and then uses the corresponding documentation to make a call.\n\nFig. 12. Pseudo code of how LLM makes an API call in API-Bank. (Image source: Li et al. 2023)\nIn the API-Bank workflow, LLMs need to make a couple of decisions and at each step we can evaluate how accurate that decision is. Decisions include:\n\nWhether an API call is needed.\nIdentify the right API to call: if not good enough, LLMs need to iteratively modify the API inputs (e.g. deciding search keywords for Search Engine API).\nResponse based on the API results: the model can choose to refine and call again if results are not satisfied.\n\nThis benchmark evaluates the agent\u2019s tool use capabilities at three levels:\n\nLevel-1 evaluates the ability to call the API. Given an API\u2019s description, the model needs to determine whether to call a given API, call it correctly, and respond properly to API returns.\nLevel-2 examines the ability to retrieve the API. The model needs to search for possible APIs that may solve the user\u2019s requirement and learn how to use them by reading documentation.\nLevel-3 assesses the ability to plan API beyond retrieve and call. Given unclear user requests (e.g. schedule group meetings, book flight/hotel/restaurant for a trip), the model may have to conduct multiple API calls to solve it.\n\nCase Studies#\nScientific Discovery Agent#\nChemCrow (Bran et al. 2023) is a domain-specific example in which LLM is augmented with 13 expert-designed tools to accomplish tasks across organic synthesis, drug discovery, and materials design. The workflow, implemented in LangChain, reflects what was previously described in the ReAct and MRKLs and combines CoT reasoning with tools relevant to the tasks:\n\nThe LLM is provided with a list of tool names, descriptions of their utility, and details about the expected input/output.\nIt is then instructed to answer a user-given prompt using the tools provided when necessary. The instruction suggests the model to follow the ReAct format - Thought, Action, Action Input, Observation.\n\nOne interesting observation is that while the LLM-based evaluation concluded that GPT-4 and ChemCrow perform nearly equivalently, human evaluations with experts oriented towards the completion and chemical correctness of the solutions showed that ChemCrow outperforms GPT-4 by a large margin. This indicates a potential problem with using LLM to evaluate its own performance on domains that requires deep expertise. The lack of expertise may cause LLMs not knowing its flaws and thus cannot well judge the correctness of task results.\nBoiko et al.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3.1", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
