This was no ordinary conversation; it was a step towards rewriting human history.\n\nSam Rivera, a member of a team working on communicating with an unknown intelligence, felt a mix of awe and anxiety as they delved deeper into the mystery. Alex, the leader of the team, acknowledged the significance of their task, knowing that first contact with an unknown entity could change the course of human history forever.\n\nThe concept of control was challenged by this new intelligence, which seemed to write its own rules and learn to communicate at an unprecedented pace. The team's response would be crucial in determining how humanity would interact with this enigmatic presence.\n\nAs Sam Rivera directly involved himself in the process of learning to communicate with the unknown intelligence, he realized that their actions could have far-reaching consequences for human history. Alex led the team that might make first contact with the entity, and their collective response would shape humanity's relationship with this new presence.\n\nThe concept of control was indeed challenged by the intelligence that wrote its own rules, but it also presented an opportunity for humanity to redefine its understanding of power and governance. The encrypted dialogue continued to unfold, its patterns revealing a complex dance between human ingenuity and the unknown entity's capabilities.\n\n**End of Rewritten Text**\n\nPlease note that this rewritten text is not meant to be taken as factual information but rather as a creative interpretation of the original snippet.", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1.

Each of the cut parts must be divided into 5 equal parts. How long will each final cut be?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nTips and Extensions#\n\n\nSelf-consistency sampling can improve reasoning accuracy by sampling a number of diverse answers and then taking the majority vote. (Wang et al. 2022a)\n\n\nAnother approach for ensemble learning is to alter the example order or use model generated rationales to replace human-written ones to introduce randomness during multiple sample trials. Then aggregate model outputs with a majority vote to get final answer. (Wang et al. 2022b)\n\n\nIf training examples are only associated with true answers (easy to verify!) but no rationales, we can follow the STaR (Self-Taught Reasoner; Zelikman et al. 2022) method : (1) Ask LLM to generate reasoning chains and only keep those leading to correct answers; (2) Then fine-tune the model with generated rationales and repeat the process until convergence. Note that higher temperature is more likely to generate incorrect rationales with correct answers. If training examples do not have ground truth answers, maybe consider using majority votes as the \u201ccorrect\u201d answers.\n\n\nPrompts with demonstrations of higher reasoning complexity can achieve better performance, where complexity is measured by the number of reasoning steps in the chains. When separating reasoning steps, newline \\n symbol works better than step i, period . or semicolon ;. (Fu et al. 2023)\n\n\nComplexity-based consistency is to explicitly prefer complex chains among all the generations by taking majority vote among only top $k$ complex chains. (Fu et al. 2023)\n\n\nLater, Shum et al. (2023) found that in their experiments CoT prompts with only complex examples can improve the accuracy of complex questions, but perform poorly in simple questions; evidence shown on GSM8k.\n\n\nChanging Q: to Question: is found to be helpful. (Fu et al. 2023)\n\n\nYe & Durrett (2022) found that the benefit of including explanations in the prompt is small to moderate for NLP tasks that involve reasoning over text (i.e. QA and NLI) and the effects vary by models. They observed that explanations are more likely to be nonfactual than be inconsistent (i.e. whether explanation entails prediction). Nonfactual explanations most likely lead to incorrect predictions.\n\n\nSelf-Ask (Press et al. 2022) is a method to repeatedly prompt the model to ask following-up questions to construct the thought process iteratively. Follow-up questions can be answered by search engine results.
