Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event,technology]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

There are remains from mounds of mountain shellfish (Cyclophorus), spring shellfish (Melania, also called Thiana), some freshwater water mollusc and some rudimentary labour tools. The main way of life of Soi Nhu's inhabitants included catching fish and shellfish, collecting fruits and digging for bulbs and roots. Their living environment was a coastal area unlike other Vietnamese cultures, for example, those found in H\u00f2a B\u00ecnh and B\u1eafc S\u01a1n.\n\nCai Beo culture (5000\u20133000 BC)[edit]\nLocated in Ha Long and Cat Ba island its inhabitants developed to the level of sea exploitation. Cai Beo culture is a link between Soi Nhu culture and Ha Long culture.[13]\n\nHa Long culture (2500\u20131500 BC)[edit]\nThis section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it.  (October 2019)\nClassical period[edit]\nSee also: Battle of B\u1ea1ch \u0110\u1eb1ng (1288)\nHa Long Bay was the setting for historical naval battles against Vietnam's coastal neighbors. On three occasions, in the labyrinth of channels in B\u1ea1ch \u0110\u1eb1ng River near the islands, the Vietnamese army stopped the Chinese invaders from landing. In 1288, General Tr\u1ea7n H\u01b0ng \u0110\u1ea1o stopped Mongol ships from sailing up the nearby B\u1ea1ch \u0110\u1eb1ng River by placing steel-tipped wooden stakes at high tide, sinking the Mongol Kublai Khan's fleet.\n\nModern period[edit]\nHa Long Bay was the site of the first ever raising of the new national flag of the Provisional Central Government of Vietnam on 5 June 1948 during the signing of the Halong Bay Agreements (Accords de la baie d\u2019Along) by High Commissioner Emile Bollaert and President Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Xu\u00e2n.[14]\nDuring the Vietnam War, many of the channels between the islands were heavily mined by the United States Navy, some of which continue to pose threats to shipping routes in the present day.\n\nGeology and geomorphology[edit]\nKarst formations\nIn 2000, UNESCO's World Heritage Committee inscribed Ha Long Bay in the World Heritage List according to its outstanding examples representing major stages of the Earth's history and its original limestone karstic geomorphologic features.
