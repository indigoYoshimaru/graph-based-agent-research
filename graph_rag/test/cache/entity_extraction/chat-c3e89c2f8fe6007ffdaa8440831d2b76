Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event,technology]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2.

The average temperature is from 15\u201325\u00a0\u00b0C (59\u201377\u00a0\u00b0F), and annual rainfall is between 2 and 2.2 metres (6.6 and 7.2\u00a0ft). Ha Long Bay has the typical diurnal tide system (tide amplitude ranges from 3.5\u20134 metres or 11\u201313 feet). The salinity is from 31 to 34.5MT in the dry season and lower in the rainy season.\n\nPopulation[edit]\nOf the 1,969 islands in Ha Long, only approximately 40 are inhabited. These islands range from tens to thousands of hectares in size, mainly in the East and Southeast of Ha Long Bay. In recent decades, thousands of villagers have been starting to settle down on the pristine islands and build new communities such as Sa T\u00f4 Island (Ha Long City) and Th\u1eafng L\u1ee3i Island (V\u00e2n \u0110\u1ed3n district).\n\nL\u00e0ng Ch\u00e0i Floating Fishing Village\nThe population of Ha Long Bay is about 1,540, mainly in C\u1eeda V\u1ea1n, Ba Hang and C\u1eb7p D\u00e8 fishing villages (H\u00f9ng Th\u1eafng Ward, Ha Long City). Residents of the bay mostly live on boats and rafts buoyed by tires and plastic jugs to facilitate the fishing, cultivating and breeding of aquatic and marine species. Fish require feeding every other day for up to three years, when they are eventually sold to local seafood restaurants for up to 300,000 Vietnamese dong per kilogram. Today, the lives of Ha Long Bay inhabitants have much improved due to new travel businesses. Residents of the floating villages around Ha Long Bay now offer bedrooms for rent, boat tours, and fresh seafood meals to tourists. While this is an isolating, back-breaking lifestyle, floating village residents are considered wealthy compared to residents of other Ha Long Bay islands.\nAt present [when?], the Qu\u1ea3ng Ninh provincial government has a policy to relocate the households living in the bay to resettle, in order to stabilize their life and to protect the landscape of the heritage zone. More than 300 households living in fishing villages in Ha Long Bay have been relocated ashore in Khe C\u00e1 Resettlement Area, now known as Zone 8 (H\u00e0 Phong Ward, Ha Long City) since May 2014. This project will continue to be implemented. The province will only retain a number of fishing villages for sightseeing tours.\n\nHistory[edit]\nStatue of Buddha inside a cave, erected in the 16\u201317th century\nSoi Nhu culture (16,000\u20135000 BC)[edit]\nLocated within Ha Long and B\u00e1i T\u1eed Long are archaeological sites such as M\u00ea Cung and Thi\u00ean Long.
