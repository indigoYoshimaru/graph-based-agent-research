{"result": "It seems like you provided a snippet from a research paper on a topic related to artificial intelligence and machine learning. The text discusses various concepts such as CoH (Contextualized History), Algorithm Distillation (AD), and their applications in improving the performance of models in tasks like communication with unknown intelligences, first contact scenarios, and reinforcement learning.\n\nHere's a rewritten version of the provided text in a more structured and coherent format:\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe concept of rewriting human history is a complex one that involves understanding and manipulating the intricate patterns of human interactions. In the context of artificial intelligence, this idea can be explored through the development of models that learn from and improve upon previous experiences.\n\n**CoH (Contextualized History)**\n\nCoH is a technique used to fine-tune models by presenting them with a history of sequentially improved outputs in context. This approach helps the model take on the trend to produce better outputs over time. CoH can be applied to various tasks, including communication with unknown intelligences and reinforcement learning.\n\n**Algorithm Distillation (AD)**\n\nAD is another technique that applies the idea of CoH to cross-episode trajectories in reinforcement learning tasks. In AD, an algorithm is encapsulated in a long history-conditioned policy, which helps the model learn from its past experiences and improve its performance over time.\n\n**Applications**\n\nThe concepts of CoH and AD have various applications in artificial intelligence and machine learning. For example:\n\n* **Communication with Unknown Intelligences**: CoH can be used to fine-tune models that communicate with unknown intelligences, allowing them to learn from their interactions and improve their responses.\n* **Reinforcement Learning**: AD can be applied to reinforcement learning tasks, helping agents learn from their past experiences and improve their performance over time.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe concepts of CoH and AD offer new insights into how models can learn from and improve upon previous experiences.

The model is finetuned to only predict $y_n$ where conditioned on the sequence prefix, such that the model can self-reflect to produce better output based on the feedback sequence. The model can optionally receive multiple rounds of instructions with human annotators at test time.\nTo avoid overfitting, CoH adds a regularization term to maximize the log-likelihood of the pre-training dataset. To avoid shortcutting and copying (because there are many common words in feedback sequences), they randomly mask 0% - 5% of past tokens during training.\nThe training dataset in their experiments is a combination of WebGPT comparisons, summarization from human feedback and human preference dataset.\n\nFig. 5. After fine-tuning with CoH, the model can follow instructions to produce outputs with incremental improvement in a sequence. (Image source: Liu et al. 2023)\nThe idea of CoH is to present a history of sequentially improved outputs  in context and train the model to take on the trend to produce better outputs. Algorithm Distillation (AD; Laskin et al. 2023) applies the same idea to cross-episode trajectories in reinforcement learning tasks, where an algorithm is encapsulated in a long history-conditioned policy. Considering that an agent interacts with the environment many times and in each episode the agent gets a little better, AD concatenates this learning history and feeds that into the model. Hence we should expect the next predicted action to lead to better performance than previous trials. The goal is to learn the process of RL instead of training a task-specific policy itself.\n\nFig. 6. Illustration of how Algorithm Distillation (AD) works. (Image source: Laskin et al. 2023).\nThe paper hypothesizes that any algorithm that generates a set of learning histories can be distilled into a neural network by performing behavioral cloning over actions. The history data is generated by a set of source policies, each trained for a specific task. At the training stage, during each RL run, a random task is sampled and a subsequence of multi-episode history is used for training, such that the learned policy is task-agnostic.\nIn reality, the model has limited context window length, so episodes should be short enough to construct multi-episode history. Multi-episodic contexts of 2-4 episodes are necessary to learn a near-optimal in-context RL algorithm. The emergence of in-context RL requires long enough context.\nIn comparison with three baselines, including ED (expert distillation, behavior cloning with expert\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3.1", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
