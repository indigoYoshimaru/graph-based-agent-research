{"result": "It appears to be a continuation of a research paper discussing the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various applications, including scientific discovery and API management.\n\nThe text describes an encrypted dialogue with intricate patterns that show anticipation, and then presents several \"entity\" and \"relationship\" pairs, which seem to be related to a project or scenario involving communication with an unknown intelligence. The entities include \"Person C\", \"PERSON B\", \"Control\", \"Intelligence\", \"First Contact\", and \"Humanity's Response\".\n\nThe text also mentions the API-Bank workflow, where LLMs need to make decisions about whether to call an API, identify the right API to call, and respond based on the API results. The benchmark evaluates the agent's tool use capabilities at three levels: Level-1 (calling the API), Level-2 (retrieving the API), and Level-3 (planning API beyond retrieval).\n\nThe case studies section discusses two examples:\n\n1. Scientific Discovery Agent: ChemCrow, a domain-specific example that uses 13 expert-designed tools to accomplish tasks across organic synthesis, drug discovery, and materials design.\n2. Boiko et al.

Because there are a large number of APIs, LLM first has access to API search engine to find the right API to call and then uses the corresponding documentation to make a call.\n\nFig. 12. Pseudo code of how LLM makes an API call in API-Bank. (Image source: Li et al. 2023)\nIn the API-Bank workflow, LLMs need to make a couple of decisions and at each step we can evaluate how accurate that decision is. Decisions include:\n\nWhether an API call is needed.\nIdentify the right API to call: if not good enough, LLMs need to iteratively modify the API inputs (e.g. deciding search keywords for Search Engine API).\nResponse based on the API results: the model can choose to refine and call again if results are not satisfied.\n\nThis benchmark evaluates the agent\u2019s tool use capabilities at three levels:\n\nLevel-1 evaluates the ability to call the API. Given an API\u2019s description, the model needs to determine whether to call a given API, call it correctly, and respond properly to API returns.\nLevel-2 examines the ability to retrieve the API. The model needs to search for possible APIs that may solve the user\u2019s requirement and learn how to use them by reading documentation.\nLevel-3 assesses the ability to plan API beyond retrieve and call. Given unclear user requests (e.g. schedule group meetings, book flight/hotel/restaurant for a trip), the model may have to conduct multiple API calls to solve it.\n\nCase Studies#\nScientific Discovery Agent#\nChemCrow (Bran et al. 2023) is a domain-specific example in which LLM is augmented with 13 expert-designed tools to accomplish tasks across organic synthesis, drug discovery, and materials design. The workflow, implemented in LangChain, reflects what was previously described in the ReAct and MRKLs and combines CoT reasoning with tools relevant to the tasks:\n\nThe LLM is provided with a list of tool names, descriptions of their utility, and details about the expected input/output.\nIt is then instructed to answer a user-given prompt using the tools provided when necessary. The instruction suggests the model to follow the ReAct format - Thought, Action, Action Input, Observation.\n\nOne interesting observation is that while the LLM-based evaluation concluded that GPT-4 and ChemCrow perform nearly equivalently, human evaluations with experts oriented towards the completion and chemical correctness of the solutions showed that ChemCrow outperforms GPT-4 by a large margin. This indicates a potential problem with using LLM to evaluate its own performance on domains that requires deep expertise. The lack of expertise may cause LLMs not knowing its flaws and thus cannot well judge the correctness of task results.\nBoiko et al.
