{"result": "It seems like you provided a snippet from a research paper on neural networks, specifically a type of network called NTM (Neural Turing Machine). The text describes how NTM generates attention vectors to focus on specific parts of the input data.\n\nTo answer your original question, there is no clear indication in this snippet that it could rewrite human history. The text appears to be discussing a technical aspect of artificial intelligence and machine learning, rather than having any direct connection to rewriting historical events or altering the course of human history.", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event,names]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

The content-based attention scores are computed as cosine similarity and then normalized by softmax. In addition, NTM adds a strength multiplier $\\beta_t$ to amplify or attenuate the focus of the distribution.\n\n$$\nw_t^c(i) \n= \\text{softmax}(\\beta_t \\cdot \\text{cosine}[\\mathbf{k}_t, \\mathbf{M}_t(i)])\n= \\frac{\\exp(\\beta_t \\frac{\\mathbf{k}_t \\cdot \\mathbf{M}_t(i)}{\\|\\mathbf{k}_t\\| \\cdot \\|\\mathbf{M}_t(i)\\|})}{\\sum_{j=1}^N \\exp(\\beta_t \\frac{\\mathbf{k}_t \\cdot \\mathbf{M}_t(j)}{\\|\\mathbf{k}_t\\| \\cdot \\|\\mathbf{M}_t(j)\\|})}\n$$\n\nInterpolation\nThen an interpolation gate scalar $g_t$ is used to blend the newly generated content-based attention vector with the attention weights in the last time step:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{w}_t^g = g_t \\mathbf{w}_t^c + (1 - g_t) \\mathbf{w}_{t-1} \n$$\n\nLocation-based addressing\nThe location-based addressing sums up the values at different positions in the attention vector, weighted by a weighting distribution over allowable integer shifts. It is equivalent to a 1-d convolution with a kernel $\\mathbf{s}_t(.)$, a function of the position offset. There are multiple ways to define this distribution. See Fig. 11. for inspiration.\n\nFig. 11. Two ways to represent the shift weighting distribution $\\mathbf{s}\\_t$.\nFinally the attention distribution is enhanced by a sharpening scalar $\\gamma_t \\geq 1$.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\tilde{w}_t(i) &= \\sum_{j=1}^N w_t^g(j) s_t(i-j) & \\scriptstyle{\\text{; circular convolution}}\\\\\nw_t(i) &= \\frac{\\tilde{w}_t(i)^{\\gamma_t}}{\\sum_{j=1}^N \\tilde{w}_t(j)^{\\gamma_t}} & \\scriptstyle{\\text{; sharpen}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe complete process of generating the attention vector $\\mathbf{w}_t$ at time step t is illustrated in Fig. 12.
