NASA claims it's barely visible, while astronaut Gene Cernan says it's visible to the naked eye at an altitude of 100-200 miles.\n\n**Interesting Facts:**\n\n* The Great Wall can be seen from space with the naked eye under favorable conditions.\n* Astronaut Leroy Chiao took a photograph from the International Space Station that shows the wall, but it was so indistinct that he wasn't certain if he had captured it.\n* The European Space Agency (ESA) reported in 2003 that the Great Wall is visible to the naked eye at an altitude of 160-320 km.\n\nPlease let me know if this meets your expectations or if you'd like me to try something else!", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event,technology]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

NASA claims that it is barely visible, and only under nearly perfect conditions; it is no more conspicuous than many other human-made objects.[77]\nVeteran US astronaut Gene Cernan has stated: \"At Earth orbit of 100 to 200 miles [160 to 320\u00a0km] high, the Great Wall of China is, indeed, visible to the naked eye.\" Ed Lu, Expedition 7 Science Officer aboard the International Space Station, adds that, \"It's less visible than a lot of other objects. And you have to know where to look.\"\nIn October 2003, Chinese astronaut Yang Liwei stated that he had not been able to see the Great Wall of China. In response, the European Space Agency (ESA) issued a press release reporting that from an orbit between 160 and 320\u00a0km (100 and 200\u00a0mi), the Great Wall is visible to the naked eye.[73] The image was actually a river in Beijing.[78]\nLeroy Chiao, a Chinese-American astronaut, took a photograph from the International Space Station that shows the wall. It was so indistinct that the photographer was not certain he had actually captured it. Based on the photograph, the China Daily later reported that the Great Wall can be seen from 'space' with the naked eye, under favorable viewing conditions, if one knows exactly where to look.[79][73]\n\nGallery\n\n\n\nThe Great Wall at Badaling\n\n\n\nThe Great Wall at dawn\n\n\n\nThe Juyongguan area of the Great Wall accepts numerous tourists each day.\n\n\n\nRemains of Beacon tower, near Yumenguan, 2011\n\n\n\n\"The First Mound\" \u2013 at Jiayu Pass, the western terminus of the Ming wall\n\n\n\nThe Great Wall near Jiayu Pass, Qilian Mountains in behind\n\n\n\nMing Great Wall remnant, near Yinchuan\n\n\n\nThe Great Wall remnant at Yulin\n\n\n\nGateway of Gubeikou Fortress\n\n\n\nEnvironmental protection sign, near Great Wall, 2011\n\n\n\nMing Great Wall at Simatai, overlooking the gorge\n\n\n\nMutianyu Great Wall.
