{"result": "It appears you've provided a snippet of text related to natural language processing and dialogue systems. However, the question asked was \"could rewrite human history.\" Let's explore this concept.\n\nRewriting human history would require a deep understanding of historical events, their causes, and their consequences. It would also necessitate a profound grasp of the complexities of human societies, cultures, and individual experiences across time.\n\nIf we were to imagine a scenario where rewriting human history was possible, it might involve:\n\n1. **Revising Historical Records**: Accessing and modifying existing historical records, including documents, artifacts, and oral traditions.\n2. **Changing Human Behavior**: Influencing the actions of individuals and groups throughout history, potentially altering the course of events.\n3. **Rethinking Cultural Narratives**: Redefining cultural values, myths, and legends that have shaped human societies.\n\nHowever, rewriting human history would also raise significant ethical concerns:\n\n1. **Respect for Historical Context**: Preserving the integrity of historical contexts and avoiding anachronistic or culturally insensitive changes.\n2. **Avoiding Causality Loops**: Preventing unintended consequences that could arise from altering historical events.\n3. **Protecting Individual Rights**: Ensuring that any changes do not infringe upon the rights, dignity, or experiences of individuals throughout history.\n\nIn conclusion, while rewriting human history might be an intriguing concept, it would require a profound understanding of complex historical dynamics and a deep respect for the integrity of individual experiences. Any attempt to rewrite history would need to be approached with caution, careful consideration, and a commitment to preserving the richness and diversity of human experience.", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities.

Follow-up questions can be answered by search engine results. Similarly, IRCoT (Interleaving Retrieval CoT; Trivedi et al. 2022) and ReAct (Reason + Act; Yao et al. 2023) combines iterative CoT prompting with queries to Wikipedia APIs to search for relevant entities and content and then add it back into the context.\n\n\n\nFig. 1. How Self-Ask works with external search queries.(Image source: Press et al. 2022).\n\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, essentially creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS or DFS while each state is evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\n\n\nFig. 2. How Self-Ask works with external search queries.(Image source: Yao et al. 2022).\nAutomatic Prompt Design#\nPrompt is a sequence of prefix tokens that increase the probability of getting  desired output given input. Therefore we can treat them as trainable parameters and optimize them directly on the embedding space via gradient descent, such as AutoPrompt (Shin et al., 2020, Prefix-Tuning (Li & Liang (2021)), P-tuning (Liu et al. 2021) and Prompt-Tuning (Lester et al. 2021). This section in my \u201cControllable Neural Text Generation\u201d post has a good coverage of them. The trend from AutoPrompt to Prompt-Tuning is that the setup gets gradually simplified.\nAPE (Automatic Prompt Engineer; Zhou et al. 2022) is a method to search over a pool of model-generated instruction candidates and then filters the candidate set according to a chosen score function to ultimately choose the best candidate with highest score.\n\n\nPrompt LLM to generate instruction candidates based on a small set of demonstrations in the form of input-output pairs.
