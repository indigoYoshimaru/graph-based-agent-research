{"result": "It appears that you've provided a snippet of text related to natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning, specifically discussing techniques for selecting examples in few-shot learning. Here's a breakdown of the output:\n\nThe first part of the output seems to be a continuation of an encrypted dialogue, with entities and relationships being discussed. The entities mentioned include \"Person C\", \"PERSON B\", \"Control\", \"Intelligence\", \"First Contact\", and \"Humanity's Response\". These entities are related to each other through various relationships.\n\nThe second part of the output appears to be a discussion on techniques for selecting examples in few-shot learning, including:\n\n1. **Contrastive Learning**: A method proposed by Rubin et al. (2022) to train embeddings via contrastive learning specific to one training dataset.\n2. **Q-Learning**: A technique tried by some researchers to do sample selection.\n3. **Uncertainty-based Active Learning**: A suggestion by Diao et al. (2023) to identify examples with high disagreement or entropy among multiple sampling trials.\n\nThe output also provides tips for example ordering, such as keeping the selection diverse and relevant to the test sample, and avoiding majority label bias and recency bias.\n\nFinally, there's a discussion on **Instruction Prompting**, which involves presenting few-shot examples in the prompt to explain the intent to the model. The text mentions that instructed LMs (e.g., InstructGPT) can be fine-tuned with high-quality tuples of (task instruction, input, ground truth output) to make the LM better understand user intention and follow instructions.\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to clarify any specific points or provide further assistance!", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event,technology]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

(2022) proposed to train embeddings via contrastive learning specific to one training dataset for in-context learning sample selection.  Given each training pair $(x, y)$, the quality of one example $e_i$ (formatted input-output pair) can be measured by a conditioned probability assigned by LM: $\\text{score}(e_i) = P_\\text{LM}(y \\mid e_i, x)$. We can identify other examples with top-$k$ and bottom-$k$ scores as positive and negative sets of candidates for every training pair and use that for contrastive learning.\n\n\nSome researchers tried Q-Learning to do sample selection. (Zhang et al. 2022)\n\n\nMotivated by uncertainty-based active learning, Diao et al. (2023) suggested to identify examples with high disagreement or entropy among multiple sampling trials. Then annotate these examples to be used in few-shot prompts.\n\n\nTips for Example Ordering#\n\nA general suggestion is to keep the selection of examples diverse, relevant to the test sample and in random order to avoid majority label bias and recency bias.\nIncreasing model sizes or including more training examples does not reduce variance among different permutations of in-context examples. Same order may work well for one model but badly for another. When the validation set is limited, consider choosing the order such that the model does not produce extremely unbalanced predictions or being overconfident about its predictions. (Lu et al. 2022)\n\nInstruction Prompting#\nThe purpose of presenting few-shot examples in the prompt is to explain our intent to the model; in other words, describe the task instruction to the model in the form of demonstrations. However, few-shot can be expensive in terms of token usage and restricts the input length due to limited context length. So, why not just give the instruction directly?\nInstructed LM (e.g. InstructGPT, natural instruction) finetunes a pretrained model with high-quality tuples of (task instruction, input, ground truth output) to make LM better understand user intention and follow instruction. RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) is a common method to do so. The benefit of instruction following style fine-tuning improves the model to be more aligned with human intention and greatly reduces the cost of communication.\nWhen interacting with instruction models\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3.1", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
