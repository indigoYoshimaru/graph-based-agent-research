Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event,technology]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

Collectively, they stretch from Liaodong in the east to Lop Lake in the west, from the present-day Sino\u2013Russian border in the north to Tao River (Taohe) in the south; along an arc that roughly delineates the edge of the Mongolian steppe; spanning 21,196.18\u00a0km (13,170.70\u00a0mi) in total.[7][3] Today, the defensive system of the Great Wall is generally recognized as one of the most impressive architectural feats in history.[8]\n\n\nNames\nHuayi tu, an 1136 map of China with the Great Wall depicted on the northern edge of the country\nThe collection of fortifications known as the Great Wall of China has historically had a number of different names in both Chinese and English.\nIn Chinese histories, the term \"Long Wall(s)\" (t \u9577\u57ce, s \u957f\u57ce, Ch\u00e1ngch\u00e9ng) appears in Sima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian, where it referred both to the separate great walls built between and north of the Warring States and to the more unified construction of the First Emperor.[9] The Chinese character \u57ce, meaning city or fortress, is a phono-semantic compound of the \"earth\" radical \u571f and phonetic \u6210, whose Old Chinese pronunciation has been reconstructed as *de\u014b.[10] It originally referred to the rampart which surrounded traditional Chinese cities and was used by extension for these walls around their respective states; today, however, it is much more often the Chinese word for \"city\".[11]\nThe longer Chinese name \"Ten-Thousand Mile Long Wall\" (t \u842c\u91cc\u9577\u57ce, s \u4e07\u91cc\u957f\u57ce, W\u00e0nl\u01d0 Ch\u00e1ngch\u00e9ng) came from Sima Qian's description of it in the Records, though he did not name the walls as such. The AD\u00a0493 Book of Song quotes the frontier general Tan Daoji referring to \"the long wall of 10,000 miles\", closer to the modern name, but the name rarely features in pre-modern times otherwise.[12] The traditional Chinese mile (\u91cc, l\u01d0) was an often irregular distance that was intended to show the length of a standard village and varied with terrain but was usually standardized at distances around a third of an English mile (540\u00a0m).[13] However, this use of \"ten-thousand\" (w\u00e0n) is figurative in a similar manner to the Greek and English myriad and simply\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3.1", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
