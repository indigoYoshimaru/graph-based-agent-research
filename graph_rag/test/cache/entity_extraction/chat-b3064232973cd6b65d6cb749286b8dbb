Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event,technology]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

Livistona halongensis, Impatiens halongensis, Chirita halongensis, Chirita hiepii, Chirita modesta, Paraboea halongensis, and Alpinia calcicola are among the seven endemic species found in the bay. There is also some bioluminescent plankton.[20]\nThe many islands that dot the bay are home to a great many other species, including (but likely not limited to): 477 magnoliales, 12 pteris, 20 salt marsh flora; and 4 amphibia, 10 reptilia, 40 aves, and 4 mammalia.\nCommon aquatic species found in the bay include: cuttlefish (m\u1ef1c); oyster (h\u00e0o); cyclinae (ng\u00e1n); prawns (penaeidea (t\u00f4m he), panulirus (t\u00f4m h\u00f9m), parapenaeopsis (t\u00f4m s\u1eaft), etc.); sipunculoideas (s\u00e1 s\u00f9ng); nerita (\u1ed1c \u0111\u0129a); charonia tritonis (\u1ed1c t\u00f9 v\u00e0); and c\u00e0 s\u00e1y. A new species of sponge, Cladocroce pansinii, was discovered in underwater caves attached to the bay in 2023.[21]\n\nEnvironmental damage[edit]\nA cruise ship docking in the bay\nWith an increasing tourist trade, mangroves and seagrass beds have been cleared and jetties and wharves have been built for tourist boats.\nGame fishing, often near coral reefs, is threatening many endangered species of fish.\nLocal government and businesses are aware of the problems and many measures have been taken to minimise the impact of tourism on the bay environment for sustainable economic growth like introducing eco-friendly tours and tight waste control on resorts.[22]\n\nAwards and designations[edit]\nIn 1962, the Vietnam Ministry of Culture, Sport and Tourism designated Ha Long Bay a 'Renowned National Landscape Monument'.\nHa Long Bay was first listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1994,[23] in recognition of its outstanding, universal aesthetic value. In 2000, the World Heritage Committee additionally recognised Ha Long Bay for its outstanding geological and geomorphological value,[12] and its World Heritage Listing was updated.[24]\nIn October 2011, the World Monuments Fund included the bay on the 2012 World Monuments Watch, citing pressure from tourism and associated developments as threats to the site that must be addressed.\nIn 2012, the New 7 Wonders Foundation officially named Ha Long Bay as one of the New 7 Wonders of Nature.\nHa Long Bay is also a part of the Club of the Most Beautiful Bays of the World.[25]\n\nPopular culture[edit]\nLiterature[edit\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3.1", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
