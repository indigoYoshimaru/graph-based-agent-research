Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event,names]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

When we see \u201ceating\u201d, we expect to encounter a food word very soon. The color term describes the food, but probably not so much with \u201ceating\u201d directly.\n\nFig. 2. One word \"attends\" to other words in the same sentence differently.\nIn a nutshell, attention in deep learning can be broadly interpreted as a vector of importance weights: in order to predict or infer one element, such as a pixel in an image or a word in a sentence, we estimate using the attention vector how strongly it is correlated with (or \u201cattends to\u201d as you may have read in many papers) other elements and take the sum of their values weighted by the attention vector as the approximation of the target.\nWhat\u2019s Wrong with Seq2Seq Model?#\nThe seq2seq model was born in the field of language modeling (Sutskever, et al. 2014). Broadly speaking, it aims to transform an input sequence (source) to a new one (target) and both sequences can be of arbitrary lengths. Examples of transformation tasks include machine translation between multiple languages in either text or audio, question-answer dialog generation, or even parsing sentences into grammar trees.\nThe seq2seq model normally has an encoder-decoder architecture, composed of:\n\nAn encoder processes the input sequence and compresses the information into a context vector (also known as sentence embedding or \u201cthought\u201d vector) of a fixed length. This representation is expected to be a good summary of the meaning of the whole source sequence.\nA decoder is initialized with the context vector to emit the transformed output. The early work only used the last state of the encoder network as the decoder initial state.\n\nBoth the encoder and decoder are recurrent neural networks, i.e. using LSTM or GRU units.\n\nFig. 3. The encoder-decoder model, translating the sentence \"she is eating a green apple\" to Chinese. The visualization of both encoder and decoder is unrolled in time.\nA critical and apparent disadvantage of this fixed-length context vector design is incapability of remembering long sentences. Often it has forgotten the first part once it completes processing the whole input. The attention mechanism was born (Bahdanau et al., 2015) to resolve this problem.\nBorn for Translation#\nThe attention mechanism was born to help memorize long source sentences in neural machine translation (NMT). Rather than building a single context vector out of the encoder\u2019s last hidden state, the secret sauce invented by attention is to create shortcuts between the context vector and the entire source input. The weights of these shortcut connections are customizable for each output element.\nWhile the context vector has access to the entire input sequence, we don\u2019t need to worry about forgetting. The alignment between the source and target is learned and controlled by the context vector. Essentially the context vector consumes three pieces of information:\n\nencoder hidden states;\ndecoder hidden states;\nalignment between source and target.\n\n\nFig.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3.1", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
